		If not, here's a small recap: The way most of us eat is not possible if everyone were to eat
		like you are. And if you know think of something like "you're better, so you deserve that", then
		get the fck out of here! So, the food we eat is too inefficient to produce in that scale so that
		everyone on earth could eat that. And not having enough food on earth will affect us Europeans
		later, but it will and as we're the same humans as the people in Africa, or whereever else on
		earth, we cannot and must not ignore the problem of malnutrition or, even worse, starvation.
